## Features

- Manage videos: upload, update, delete, and mark as watched.
- Manage students: create, update, delete, and retrieve student information.
- Manage sections: create, update, delete, and retrieve sections by course.
- Manage professors: create, update, delete, and retrieve professor information.
- Manage courses: create, update, delete, and retrieve course details, as well as enroll and disenroll students.
- Evaluate activities: create and save evaluation results.
- Issue certificates for completed courses.
- Integrates with RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous tasks, such as sending messages when a user is created.


## Technologies

- **Spring Boot** - Framework for building the REST API.
- **Spring Security** - For securing the application.
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing application data.
- **Azure Storage Blob** - For handling Azure Blob 
- **JavaMailSender** - For sending emails.
- **Redis** - For caching
- **RabbitMQ** - For handling asynchronous messaging.
- **Swagger** - API documentation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WiliamMelo01/EmpowerU-API.git
    cd EmpowerU-API
    ```

2. Update the `application-dev.properties` file with your database and email configurations:

   ```properties
    # DATABASE CONFIGS
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/empoweru
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=1234
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

    # HIBERNATE CONFIGS
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    # FILE UPLOAD CONFIGS
    spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=200MB
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=300MB

    # AZURE STORAGE
    spring.cloud.azure.storage.blob.account-name=your-azure-blob-account-name
    spring.cloud.azure.storage.blob.endpoint=your-azure-blob-endpoint
    spring.cloud.azure.storage.blob.connection-string=your-azure-blob-connection-string

    # REDIS CONFIGS
    spring.cache.type=redis
    spring.data.redis.host=localhost
    spring.data.redis.port=6379
    spring.data.redis.password=12345

    # JWT CONFIGS
    jwt.secret=jwt-dev-secret

    # RABBITMQ CONFIGS
    spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
    spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
    spring.rabbitmq.username=default
    spring.rabbitmq.password=1234
    rabbitmq.exchange=emailExchange
    rabbitmq.routingkey=emailRoutingKey

    # SERVER CONFIGS
    local.server.host=https://localhost:8080
    ```

3. Ensure that the application is using the `dev` profile by setting the active profile in `application.properties`:

    ```properties
    # application.properties
    spring.profiles.active=dev
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    
## Usage

- The API provides endpoints for managing videos, students, sections, professors, courses, evaluations, and certificates.
- For detailed information on available endpoints and their usage, refer to the Swagger documentation available at `/swagger-ui.html` once the application is running.

### User Creation and RabbitMQ Integration

When a new user is created via the `/auth/public/register/student` or `/auth/public/register/professor` endpoints, a message is sent to RabbitMQ. This message can be consumed by another microservice for further processing, such as sending a welcome email. For more information on the microservice handling these messages, visit the [EmpowerU Greetings Microservice](https://github.com/WiliamMelo01/EmpowerUGreettingsMicroService).

### Password Recovery

For handling password recovery requests, the EmpowerU Password Recovery Microservice is responsible for sending recovery codes and updating passwords. For more information, visit the [EmpowerU Password Recovery Microservice](https://github.com/WiliamMelo01/EmpowerUPasswordRecoveryMicroService).

### Certificate Generation

The issuance of certificates for completed courses is handled by a separate microservice. For more details on this service, visit the [EmpowerU Certificate Generation Microservice](https://github.com/WiliamMelo01/EmpowerUCertificateMicroService).

## TODO

### FIX

- [ ] **Certificate Issuance Verification**: Update the API to use HTTP requests instead of RabbitMQ messages for communicating with the certificate generation microservice. Ensure the API verifies if the user has completed all requirements before making the HTTP request.

### TODO
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password update endpoint.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track the usage and performance of the microservice.
- [ ] **Improve General Performance**: Optimize the overall performance of the API to handle higher loads and reduce response times.
